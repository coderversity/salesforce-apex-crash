## Introduction

Salesforce Apex is a powerful and versatile programming language specifically designed for developing and extending functionality within the Salesforce platform. It allows developers to build custom applications, automate business processes, and add new features to Salesforce, making it a key tool for Salesforce developers. This crash course will highlight some of the core features of the Apex programming language.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, you can:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Explore the code examples and resources provided in each section.
- Follow along with the code examples, modify them, and experiment to deepen your understanding.
- Refer to the README files within each section for more detailed explanations and instructions.

You will also need to install Salesforce CLI v2. We walk you through these steps in the crash course.

## Topics Covered

The course covers the following fundamental topics:

- Variables and Data Types
- Operators
- Control Flow (Conditional Statements and Loops)
- Arrays and Collections
- Functions (Methods)
- Classes and Objects
- Exception Handling

## Code Examples

There are two places you need to look for in this project:

## scripts/apex/examples.apex

This is the main script file that all example code is written in. You can anonymously run this script with the following command in the terminal:

`sf apex run -f scripts/apex/example.apex`

OR you can:

- copy the code and log into Salesforce
- Open Developer Console (in Lightning, click the top right gear icon > Developer Console)
- In Developer Console, click Debug > Open Execute Anonymous Window
- Paste the code into the window and click Execute

NOTE: You will need to push all dependent classes and objects to your org first. Review the Salesforce Developer documentation online and/or Trailhead to get step-by-step directions on how to deploy your code and metadata.
